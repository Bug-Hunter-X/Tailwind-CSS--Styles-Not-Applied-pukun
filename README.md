# Tailwind CSS - Styles Not Applied

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components.

The problem occurs when the `content` option in the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`) does not correctly specify the locations of your components' source files.  This can result in Tailwind not processing your classes and therefore not including them in the final CSS output.

## Bug:
The initial `content` option might miss crucial file extensions, leading to Tailwind CSS not picking up styles.

## Solution:
Ensure your `content` option specifies all relevant file extensions correctly, including `.html`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx`  to include a wider range of files.

## How to reproduce the bug and solution
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Navigate to the `bug` directory and observe the error
4. Navigate to the `bugSolution` directory and observe the fix
